'''
Given the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST), convert it to a Greater Tree such that every key of the original BST is changed to the original key plus the sum of all keys greater than the original key in BST.

As a reminder, a binary search tree is a tree that satisfies these constraints:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right

class Solution:
    def convertBST(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        sumOfValues = 0
        
        def traversal(node):
            if not node:
                return
            
            nonlocal sumOfValues
            traversal(node.right)
            temp = node.val
            node.val += sumOfValues
            sumOfValues += temp
